Open-Fashion: Documentation Simplified
=======================================

.. meta::
   :description lang=en: Automate building, versioning, and hosting of your technical documentation continuously on Read the Docs.

`open-fashion-docs`_ simplifies software documentation
by building, versioning, and hosting of Smart Fashion docs, automatically.
Think of it as *Continuous Documentation*.

Never out of sync |:arrows_counterclockwise:|
    Whenever you push code to your favorite version control system,
    whether that is Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, or Subversion,
    Read the Docs will automatically build your docs
    so your code and documentation are always up-to-date.
    Read more about :doc:`/webhooks`.

Multiple versions |:card_index_dividers:|
    Read the Docs can host and build multiple versions of your docs
    so having a 1.0 version of your docs and a 2.0 version
    of your docs is as easy as having a separate branch or tag in your version control system.
    Read more about :doc:`/versions`.
